# to import database library:
import sqlite3

# to connect to/create database:
dbConnection = sqlite3.connect('blackboard.db')

# to create a new table (this one is only an example
dbConnection.execute('''CREATE TABLE TABLENAME
    (COL1NAME  INTEGER NOT NULL  UNIQUE,
    COL2NAME   TEXT    NOT NULL,
    COL3NAME   REAL    NOT NULL,
    COL3NAME   BLOB    NOT NULL);''')

# one example for a function to get a value from a table
def getData(tableName, columName, condition, fulfillment):
    sqlCommand = "SELECT " + columName + " FROM " + tableName + " WHERE " + condition + " = \"" + fulfillment + "\""
    cursor = dbConnection.execute(sqlCommand)
    for row in cursor:
        return row[0]
# this looks funny, but basically you're executing a regular SQL command
# "SELECT COLUMNAME FROM TABLENAME WHERE CONDITION = FULFILLMENT"
# and then parsing through the table that you get in return. cursor is the whole table while row is one row.
# if your output table has multiple values per row, you'd need to access them by calling something like
# row[0], row[1], row[2], etc.

# to add a new row into a DB table, here's a function:
def newDataEntry(tableName, value1, value2, value3, value4):
    value1 = str(value1)
    value2 = str(value2)
    value3 = str(value3)
    value4 = str(value4)
    sqlCommand = "INSERT INTO " + tableName + " (COL1NAME, COL2NAME, COL3NAME, COL3NAME) VALUES (\"" + value1 + "\", \"" + value2 + "\", " + value3 + ", " + value4 + ")"
    dbConnection.execute(sqlCommand)
    dbConnection.commit()
# this function makes sure your insert values are strings then calls the SQL command
# "INSERT INTO TABLENAME (COL1NAME, COL2NAME, COL3NAME, COL3NAME) VALUES ("VALUE1", "VALUE2", "VALUE3", "VALUE4")"
# Note that not only do you have to execute this command, but you also have to commit it.
