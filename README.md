# Software Architecture PySimpleGUI Moon Lander

Simply download the source code, make sure you have python installed (we used python 3.11.4), and make sure you have PySimpleGUI downloaded.

### To insall PySimpleGUI (on Windows):

Install PIP from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

Run "python get-pip.py" in the directory you downloaded get-pip.py to

Run "pip install PySimpleGUI"

### To run this program:

Run "python lander_input_GUI.py" in the directory that you downloaded this source code to.

Currently, this program uses the Windows dependent library "winsound." You can easily disable this in the source code, though.
